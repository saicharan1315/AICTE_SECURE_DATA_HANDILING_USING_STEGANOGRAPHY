# AICTE_SECURE_DATA_HANDILING_USING_STEGANOGRAPHY
Secure data hiding in images using steganography involves protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access by concealing it within digital images.
Traditional encryption methods are vulnerable to interception and detection. This project aims to develop a robust steganographic technique that ensures data confidentiality and integrity while maintaining image quality and minimizing the risk of detection.
